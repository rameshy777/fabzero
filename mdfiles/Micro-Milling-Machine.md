![Micro Milling](/images/micro-milling-machine.jpeg)    

Micro  Milling  Machine is a Computer Numerical Control(CNC) Milling tool.
It is a   3axis cutter and used for  2D & 3D cutting. The resolution is one 100th of a millimeter.
Safety is very important  when using this machine. During emergency, hit the stop button.
Always it is recommended to have one more person while working with this machine.
This machine will work smoothly for more than ten years.
If power goes off then it is almost like loss of work for beginners.

The SRM-20 portable milling machine can mill a broad range of materials,   
including modeling wax, chemical wood, foam, acrylic, poly acetate, ABS and PC board. 

***The following items are just some of the prototypes and applications made possible:***
Product inventions 
Wax molds for casting 
Tools and machinery 
Relief plaques and graphics
Vehicle prototypes 
Game and model parts 
Fine Art 


***Milling Made Easy with a User-Friendly VPanel***
The SRM-20â€™s VPanel controller provides a simple interface for adjusting tool position and
moving the cursor to set the milling starting point. The VPanel also allows easy control 
of feed rate and spindle speed with pause and resume operation, plus tracking of X,Y,Z axis
milling with a numeric readout in millimeters or inches.
