# Vinyl-Cutter
![Vinyl-Cutter](/images/roland-vinyl-cutter.jpeg)

We had a   look   at   vinyl cutter(Sticker cutter). Maximum 80 grams equivalent force can be applied.
The Velocity is 20. It acts like a plotter, we  can   use  it  to draw images and it  can   be   used  as  stencil and for screen printing. If we select fast speed, prints faster, with low quality. If we select normal speed, we print at medium time with normal quality. If we select low speed, we get very good quality print but takes more time to print.

A vinyl cutter uses a computer-controlled blade to cut out shapes designed using vector graphics. The vinyl cutter is primarily used for cutting vinyl into signs or stickers, but can also be used to cut copper tape into circuit traces.
inkscape is used  to prepare the files for the vinyl cutter.

File Preparation:
vinyl cutter files must contain only vectors.
The vectors must be lines only, with no fill.
The vinyl cutter drivers can only interpret cut lines.
All vectors must be contained within the bounds of the document canvas.

Document Setup:
We need to size our page in our drawing program appropriately for the width of vinyl that we are using. Vinyl comes in two widths, 24" and 15".

Document Setup:
Step 1: From the "File" menu > select "Document Properties"
Step 2: Modify the Document Width
The document properties dialog box will open.
Set the units to inches.
Set the document width the vinyl width (22" or 13").
Step 3: Modify the Document Height
Vinyl is on a roll - so the max height could be as long as the length of vinyl on the rolll.
Set the document height to a minimum of 24" (if using wide vinyl) or to a larger value that whatever value works for our drawing.
Make sure you hit the key after each entry to ensure Inkscape registers your changes.
Step 4: Create a Vector Drawing
Step 5: Select the Vector
Step 6: Then click "Object" menu > Fill and Stroke.
The fill and stroke panel will appear to on the right of the screen.
Step 7: Make sure there is no fill by clicking on the "X" button in the "Fill" menu.
Step 8: Click the stroke paint tab. Make sure "R" is at the max - "255".
Step 9: Go to stroke style and make sure width is set to 0.500 pt.

Loading Vinyl
Select a roll of vinyl and place it on the rollers behind the machine.
On the back right of the machine we will see a lever; place it in the "down" position so you can load      the vinyl.
Make sure the vinyl side is facing up as we feed it through the rollers into the vinyl cutter.
Under the rubber wheels there is a white sticker indicator.
Ensure that the vinyl is aligned properly under the rubber wheels.
The left wheel must always be under the wide white sticker on the left.
The right rubber wheel must be under any one of the three white stickers on the right, depending on        the width of the vinyl.
Make sure the vinyl is straight and about 2-3 inches past the rubber wheels.
After inserting the vinyl into the machine, pull up the lever at the back of the machine to ensure that the vinyl is securely loaded.
Turn On the Vinyl Cutter
On the left side of the vinyl cutter is the power button.
Turn it on.
Now we will notice on the screen it says "select roll".
Press the enter button.
The vinyl cutter will measure the width of the roll (in mm). Take note of the measurement, we many need to adjust the width of our file depending on the measured width of the vinyl.
Set the origin by pressing the "Origin" button on the control panel.
Print to the Vinyl Cutter
To print the file, go to File > Print > select the "vinyl cuter" driver from the print menu.
Hit the "print" button to send the file to the vinyl cutter.
The vinyl cutter will begin printing once we send the print job.
After the vinyl cutter is done cutting our file, use scissors to cut off the section with our cut design.
Weed the Vinyl
"Weeding" the cut vinyl is the process of removing the unwanted areas from the final cut design.

Gather our Tools
Transfer Tape
Scissors
X-Acto knife
Tweezers
Trim
After cutting, trim area we want to keep with scissors.
Weed
Then remove the unwanted parts of vinyl with an X-Axcto knife and / or tweezers.
Transfer to the Desired Surface
Carefully apply transfer tape to the surface of the weeded vinyl. Rub the transfer tape onto the vinyl to form a strong bond between the tape and the top surface of the vinyl design.
After rubbing, carefully pull the transfer tape (with the vinyl adhering to it) away from the vinyl paper backing.
After we have removed the vinyl from the paper backing and it is attached to the transfer tape, apply it to the desired surface. Rub the surface of the transfer tape to ensure that the vinyl will adhere to the new surface.
Carefully pull the transfer tape away from the vinyl, leaving the vinyl attached to the desired surface.
Troubleshooting
The vinyl pressure must be adequate to cut through the vinyl, but too much force will tear up the paper under the vinyl.
The thicker the material, the more pressure (force) we need to apply to cut through it.
However, if we are ripping up the vinyl or paper under the vinyl, our force setting is too high.
There are two factors that affect our cuts: force and speed.

To adjust the force:
Rotate the wheel under the LCD screen on the vinyl cutter to the right.
When the menu reads "Force", then press the menu buton.
To reduce / increase the force setting, rotate the wheel up or down, you will see the values change in the LCD screen.
When finished, press the enter button.
Next, preform a test cut by pressing the "test" button on the vinyl cutter.

To adjust the speed:
If our file has lots of small curves or tiny details, we may need to slow down the speed. The slower the speed of the machine, the more precisely it will cut.
1.	Rotate the wheel under the LCD screen on the vinyl cutter to the right until the the menu reads "Speed", then press the menu button.
2.	To reduce / increase the speed setting, rotate the wheel up or down, we will see the values change in the LCD screen.
3.	When finished, press the enter button.
4.	Next, perform a test of a small section of a file with tiny details or small curves to test the settings.
