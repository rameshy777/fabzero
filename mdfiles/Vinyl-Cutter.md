We had a   look   at   vinyl cutter(Sticker cutter). Maximum 80 grams equivalent force can be applied.
The Velocity is 20. It acts like a plotter, we  can   use  it  to draw images and it  can   be   used  as  stencil and for screen printing. If we select fast speed, prints faster, with low quality. If we select normal speed, we print at medium time with normal quality. If we select low speed, we get very good quality print but takes more time to print.

A vinyl cutter uses a computer-controlled blade to cut out shapes designed using vector graphics. The vinyl cutter is primarily used for cutting vinyl into signs or stickers, but can also be used to cut copper tape into circuit traces.
inkscape is used  to prepare the files for the vinyl cutter.

File Preparation
Overview
•	Your vinyl cutter files must contain only vectors.
•	The vectors must be lines only, with no fill.
•	The vinyl cutter drivers can only interpret cut lines.
•	All vectors must be contained within the bounds of the document canvas.
Document Setup
    You will need to size your page in your drawing program appropriately for the width of vinyl that you are using. Vinyl comes in two widths, 24" and 15".
