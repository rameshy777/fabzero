# Aim of the Project: 

The main aim of the project is to develop an iBELL, intelligent BELL. 

Intelligence means "to fool others". 
If A fools B, then A is intelligent than B.  
It is not always true that "All intelligents are not fools".
Also, it is  not  true  that " All fools  are not intelligents". 

In  our day today life, we  always try  to play  an intelligent  role.  
But  still sometimes once a while we may be fooled by others. 

We can act intelligently  on  those  which we see, or on  those that happen in front of us.  
But, it is challenging to play an intelligent role over the events that happens behind us. 

So, this thought has  motivated us to develop an intelligent system called "iBELL" 
which helps us to be intelligent  even behind our eye  sight.
